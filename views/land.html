                <h1>ABOUT ONE PIECE</h1>

                <h2>The world of One Piece is populated by humans and many other races, such as dwarves,
                    fish-men, and giants. It is covered by two vast oceans, which are divided by a massive
                    mountain range called the Red Line; The Grand Line, a sea that runs perpendicular to the Red
                    Line,
                    further divides them into four seas: North Blue, East Blue, West Blue, and South Blue.
                    Surrounding the Grand Line are two regions called Calm Belts, similar to horse latitudes,
                    which experience almost no wind or ocean currents and are the breeding ground for huge sea
                    creatures called sea kings.
                    Because of this, the calm belts are very effective barriers for those trying to enter the Grand
                    Line.

                    <!-- However, navy ships, members of an intergovernmental organization known as the World Government,
                        are able to use a sea-prism stone to mask their presence from the sea kings and can simply pass
                        through the calm belts.
                        All other ships are forced to take a more dangerous route, going through a mountain at the first
                        intersection of the Grand Line and
                        the Red Line, a canal system known as Reverse Mountain. Sea water from each of the four seas
                        runs up that mountain and
                        merges at the top to flow down a fifth canal and into the first half of the Grand Line, called
                        Paradise because how it compared to the second half.
                        The second half of the Grand Line, beyond the second intersection with the Red Line, is known as
                        the New World.</h2>  -->

                    <h1>The Legend Eiichiro Oda</h1>
                    <h2>
                        In real life, Oda is a Japanese man of average height, with few (if any)
                        distinguishing features. When not in formal settings, he favors casual,
                        Western-style clothing. Like most mangaka, Oda typically uses outlandish caricatures to
                        represent
                        himself in printed works. The most common of these is a striped tropical fish,
                        best known for "giving" all of Oda's weekly comments in Shonen Jump's table of contents; in more
                        detailed depictions (such as the Color Walks'
                        Monochrome Talk headers), this fish is usually given human ears and affixed atop a human body
                        like a mask.
